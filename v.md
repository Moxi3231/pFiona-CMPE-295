## Comprehensive Guide to Setting Up and Operating the pFiona System

### I. Introduction

This document provides a detailed, step-by-step guide for setting up and operating the pFiona System, a Raspberry Pi-based sample processing system. It encompasses procedures for initiating scripts on the Pi, installing a Django application, and managing pFiona system operations.

### II. Preparing the System

#### A. Initiating Scripts on Raspberry Pi

1. **Running the Initiate_State_Cycle.py File**
   - Navigate to the `pFiona_run_cycle` folder.
   - Execute the script using the command:
     ```
     python Initiate_State_Cycle.py
     ```

2. **Executing the command_server.py File**
   - Switch to the `Server` folder.
   - Run the file with the command:
     ```
     python command_server.py
     ```

### III. Setting Up a Django Application

#### A. Prerequisites

1. **Python Installation**
   - Confirm that Python is installed on your system.
   - If not, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Virtual Environment Setup**
   - Install `virtualenv` using:
     ```
     pip install virtualenv
     ```
   - Create a virtual environment named `pFionaUIenv` (already available in the folder).
   - Activate the environment:
     - For Windows:
       ```
       .\pFionaUIenv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - For Unix or MacOS:
       ```
       source pFionaUIenv/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Installation of Required Packages**
   - Install necessary Python packages using:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     (Note: The requirements file is provided in the code directory and the packages might already be installed.)

#### B. Django Project Configuration

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a new Django project (if not already created) with:
     ```
     django-admin startproject pFionaUI
     ```
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd pFionaUI
     ```

2. **Running the Development Server**
   - Start the Django development server with:
     ```
     python manage.py runserver
     ```
   - Access the Django application via a web browser at `http://localhost:8000/` or `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

### IV. Operating the pFiona System

#### A. System Overview

1. **Components of pFiona System**
   - The pFiona system integrates various components like a centralized dashboard, logging features, data visualization tools, and PI control mechanisms.

#### B. Dashboard Utilization

1. **Accessing Real-time Insights**
   - Utilize the dashboard for a comprehensive view of the systemâ€™s status and device information.

2. **Logs Management**
   - Monitor system events through Debug Logs, Operational Logs, and All Logs for efficient troubleshooting.

3. **Data Visualization**
   - Engage with user-friendly tables and dynamic charts for an in-depth analysis of the system's performance.

4. **Graphical Representations**
   - Analyze data trends through dynamic charts, including wavelength versus samples representation.

#### C. PI Control and Script Operation Modes

1. **Script Execution Modes**
   - Select from Automatic, Pause, Full Manual, User-specified, and Command Line Modes for script operation, based on requirements.

2. **Real-time System Adjustments**
   - Optimize operations using the State Machine for precise control.

#### D. Establishing Connection with PI

1. **Initiating and Terminating Connection**
   - Start the connection by pressing "Start Connection with PI" and wait for 10-20 seconds.
   - Terminate the connection by selecting "Stop Connection with PI."

2. **Resetting Connection**
   - Use "Enable Reset Connection" followed by "Reset Connection" for troubleshooting.

3. **Error Management**
   - Address connection issues with the "Enable Reset Connection" feature.
